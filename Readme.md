NOTES: 

1) As Pancard.csv is a sample dataset, so replace the email_id coumn with the valid email id to which you want to send the OTP.

2) All python files have been configured with the sender's email id and password, so change it to the one from which you want to send.

3) For project purpose we have created a dummy email_id which is being used in all the python files.
