NOTES:

1) As Pancard.csv is a sample dataset, so replace the email_id column with the valid email id to which you want to send the OTP.

2) All python files have been configured with the sender's email id and password, so change it to the one from which you want to send.

3) For project purposes we have created a dummy email_id which is being used in all the python files.

4) After changing the email id in the python file, go to the account settings of that email id and give permission to send emails from the third-party app.
